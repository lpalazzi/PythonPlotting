## [Assignment 2: Plotting Weather Patterns](a2)
The [data](a2/C2A2_data.csv) for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Daily Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt) (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe. The data subset used is near **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States**.

The [code](a2/code.py) generates a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day is shaded. Overlaid is a scatter plot of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
